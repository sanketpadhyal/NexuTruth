# 🔗 NexuTruth — AI Fake News Defender  

**NexuTruth** is a creative, AI-powered website that helps users detect **fake news** instantly.  
Designed with an elegant, colorful UI and optimized for both desktop 💻 and mobile 📱, this project blends frontend design with backend AI intelligence.  

⚡ **Important Note:**  
NexuTruth **uses a Replit backend (`index.js`) for API functions** 🔐, so you don’t need to worry about exposing API keys.  
Since the backend is manual, if the web app isn’t working, please **contact the admin to turn on the backend**.
